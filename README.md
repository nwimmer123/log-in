##Thoughts

I already had an existing project that met many of the criterea for this challenge, so I used my existing resource. I stripped out the unneeded code and restyled it to meet your needs.

I used jade instead of Javascript to control what the user sees based on their session status because I think it easier to place view logic right in the view page.
